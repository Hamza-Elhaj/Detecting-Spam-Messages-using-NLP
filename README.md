# Detecting-Spam-Messages-using-NLP

We aim in this project to analyse a punch of messages in order to detect whether the received messages are spam or ham (not spam). 

In this project, we followed the following machine learning pipeline to clean the data and prepare it for machine learning model development.

1. Read in raw text.
2. Clean text and tokenize.
3. Feature engineering.
4. Fit simple model.
5. Tune hyperparameters and evaluate with GridSearchCV.
6. Final model selection.
